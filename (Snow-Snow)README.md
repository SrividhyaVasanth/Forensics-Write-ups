To solve this we use the online snow steganography tool
Once it is installled we set it up to the location of our snow files location

to operate snow we use the command

snow -C -p (password) outfile name
As we have saved our data in a .txt file

snow -C -p (password) snowman.txt

After this the message hidden in the data of the txt file will appear.
